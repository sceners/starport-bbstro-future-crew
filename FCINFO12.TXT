        Welcome to the FCINFO.TXT file version 1.2 !

	This textfile is a update to FCINFO10.TXT (version 1.0). The updated
        parts are section 13 and the release list. In addition, voting form
        has been removed.

        This textfile was written to tell you about Future Crew, to
        give you answers to most of the things you would probably like
        to ask us, and to tell you how to get more demos.

        If you are interested in us making a demo for you, please,
        start reading from the next paragraph in this file.

        The things discussed in this textfile are mainly aimed to
        those people who have not seen much demos before, but are very
        interested in learning more about them and about the whole
        demo scene (=demo world) in general. In the future versions
        there will be changes and additions taking into account what
        has happened since the last information package.

        If you find our demos interesting and would like us to make
        you one for commercial purposes, do not hesitate to contact us.

        When contacting us, please, include a short explanation of
        what kind of a demo you are interested in. That would greatly
        help us in evaluating the size of the project.
        Kindly include, for example, these kinds of information:

        - What kinds of demo effects would you be interested in
        - Should there be any colorful still-pictures (logos, etc.)
        - If the demo should have sound, which sound cards would you like
          to be supported, what type of music should be played, etc.
        - How big the demo could be in kilobytes and for how long
          should the demo run in minutes approximately.
        - Where would the demo be used and how soon would you like the
          demo to be finished.

        We would like you to understand that our demos are not animations.
        This means that nearly everything you see on the screen is being
        real-time calculated. The speed of the movement is usually
        dependant to the speed of the VGA card and the speed of the
        processor.

        When contacting us, you should realise that we are all rather
        young and thus still studying in various schools. This is why
        our time is usually quite limited. And it is very likely that
        we might already be involved in another project.

        You should also know that we do not make demos for Microsoft
        Windows due to its limitations from an assembly language
        programming point of view.

        Since normal mail is quite a slow way to communicate, we would
        prefer the communication be made through e-mail or fax.

        You can find our contact information from this file.

        All our demos, except the ones which we have created for different

        This means that you can copy and distribute them freely as long
        as you make no modifications to them. Also, no money can be 
        charged for copying them.
        
        If you are a PD distributor, please contact us before including
        our products in your collection.

        In general, all commercial utilization of our demos without our
        permission is forbidden. This includes selling disks containing
        our demos.

³5:                     INTERNATIONAL DEMO COMPETITIONS                       ³

        For those who have no idea what the above are, I will explain.
        Demo competitions (= parties) are international events where
        the demo scene people go to meet each other and to compete in
        the many competitions that are being held. These competitions
        (= compos) are the demo, intro (= a demo sized under 100kb), 
        music and graphics. There are often different compos for different 
        machines (PC, Amiga, Atari ST and C-64). There are also prizes in
        each compo (cash or computer hardware & software). The cash prizes
        are usually the money people pay as the entrance fee (usually 
        about $20 US) and the possible computer hardware & software has
        usually been sponsored by various computer companies. All 
        contributions are being experienced on a big screen (many meters
        wide) and with the aid of a powerful audio system. After this all
        the people or a selected jury vote and decide which contributions
        are the best. After this the prizes are being given out and the 
        party is over. In the process people of course get to know each
        other better and exchange a lot of new ideas.

        All contributions are usually being released at the party itself,
        but sometimes the PC demos are not. This is very unfortunate,
        and will probably change in the future. The reason why this is
        allowed to happen is becouse most demos haven't been beta-tested
        well enough before the party and might not work on most machines.
        So, the groups are being allowed to finish their demos after the
        party and then release them when they so see fit.

        Parties usually last for three days (a weekend) and are usually
        organized by bigger demo groups.

        There are a few big demo parties being held annually.
        These include the following: The Party in Denmark at Christmas-
        time, The Gathering in Norway around Easter, The Computer
        Crossroad in Sweden before the summer and Assembly in Finland
        in the end of Summer. The biggest of these is The Party, which
        is being held for the third time this Christmas. And the most
        recent party was Assembly'93, which was held for the second time.

        A few months before the party, the organizing demo groups usually
        release special invitation demos to advertise their parties.

        At Assembly'93 there were a total of 1500 attenders from which
        550 were PC people. About half of them had come from outside
        Finland (Germany, Belgium, Holland, Sweden, Norway, USA, Israel,
        Canada, Denmark, Switzerland, Spain, etc...). Only PC people were
        allowed to vote on PC compos.

        The overall quality of the contributions exceeded all expectations.
        It was very cool to see how much the PC scene had developed since
        last year. The party itself went quite smoothly, except for a
        few bumps, but what would a demo party be without them... :-)
        Also the prizes were very good in all PC compos. The total value
        of all the prizes on the PC was about $7800 US.

        Next we would like to thank all the companies which sponsored
        most of the PC side prizes at Assembly'93:

                Advanced Gravis, Canada

                Epic MegaGames, USA

                The Waite Group Press, USA

                Terton, Finland

                HiCompu, Finland

                Toptronics, Finland

                Pro Component, Finland

                Lan Vision, Finland

                Data Fellows, Finland


        The thanks to all the sponsoring companies are also in the end
        scroller of the demo. We hope to see you also next year!

        And to all you people out there:

        Don't forget to attend Assembly'94 next summer !

        Here we have compiled a list of questions along with the
        answers (in random order) which are being asked in about
        95% of all the letters we receive. Hopefully you will find
        the answers to your questions from here and save us and
        yourself from some unneeded paperwork.

Q: Where can I get your and other groups' demos?
A: There are several ways to get demos.
   The best way (if you have a modem) is to call an FC distribution site
   near you. They have all of our productions online and you can download
   them freely. Also many normal BBSes carry our productions and other
   groups' demos. If you don't have a modem, then getting our demos is a
   lot harder. We don't have a mailswapping system. So, if you have a friend
   who has a modem, why not try to get him to call one of our distribution
   sites. Another VERY good way to get demos is from the INTERNET. A very
   good demo site is ftp.uwp.edu which carries probably the best demo
   collection on internet.

Q: When is the musicdisk coming out ?
A: We will probably release a sort of musicdisk at TheParty '93. It will
   feature a long-awaited MOD/S3M-player for GUS/SB/SBPro and a nice pile of
   Skaven's and Purple Motion's best S3M songs.

Q: When is Scream Tracker 3.0 going to be out?
A: Scream Tracker 3.0 is a product which might or might not ever be out.
   This is very ambiguous, but the problem is that ST3 is not a high
   priority project. The coder, Psi, is studying at a university, coding
   demos, doing commercial software and trying to spend some freetime.
   So at the moment there is no time to finish ST3 and no set release date.

Q: When is Worldcharts issue #2 coming out?
A: Since there are a lot of other groups publishing all kinds of magazines
   today and our main directive is to make demos, and that Worldcharts #1
   wasn't as good a success as we wanted it to be, we see no real sense in
   in continuing to publish it anymore. Also as you might have guessed our
   time has become too limited for these kinds of projects. In a nutshell,
   at this time there is no real reason for you to send in your votes or
   articles. If we change our minds about this, you can be sure that we'll
   let you know. Thanks to everyone who supported us by sending us votes
   and articles.

Q: What programming books would you recommend to learn assembler and VGA?
A: This is a hard question, and a general answer is, that any book will do.
   You can get the basics from a book and books are a great reference,
   but when it comes to creating something new, you can't just read it
   from a book. We have all learned to code the hard way (a lot of
   miscellaneous books and a lot of experimenting). Anyway, here are 
   some of the books we often find handy (there are undoutedly newer 
   prints, so check them out):

        Mastering Turbo Assembler, Tom Swan
                Hayden Books 1989, ISBN 0-672-48435-8
        PC System Programming, Michael Tischer
                Abacus 1990, ISBN 1-55755-036-0
        The Programmers PC Sourcebook, Thom Hogan
                Microsoft Press 1988, ISBN 1-55615-118-7
        Programming the 80386, John H. Crawford and Patrick P. Gelsinger
                Sybex 1987, ISBN 0-89588-381-3
        Programmers guide to EGA and VGA cards, Richard F. Ferraro
                Addison Wesley 1989, ISBN 0-201-12692-3

   Also, most up to date are many software 'books', such as interrupt 
   lists from bbs'es and such. We have also found a lot of valuable
   information in articles and such. In short, there is no magic
   way of learning to code, it really does take hard work.

Q: Are you going to make games in the future ?
A: Why not. It all depends if we have the time. We have a few game
   ideas cooking, but they are far from being completed. But we will
   let you all know when we have a game coming, don't you worry!

Q: What do the members of Future Crew do besides computers ?
A: Most of us study in various schools; universities, high schools and
   colleges. In real life most of us are quite normal(?) human beings.
   Our hobbies are for example, sci-fi, movies, weight-lifting, techno,
   hi-fi, etc, etc. And most of us have or has had a girlfriend.

Q: What sound cards will you support?
A: At the moment our productions support the following sound cards:

        Gravis UltraSound   - for it's programming advantages
        Sound Blaster Pro   - for being a standard
        Sound Blaster       - same here

   Support to other sound cards is always possible, but right now we
   don't see enough demand to support any other cards.

Q: Why do your demos require a 386 or higher to run?
A: There are several reasons for the requirement; For example, 386 has many
   new assembler commands, 32bit registers, and of course more processing
   power. There isn't simply enough processing power in 286 to run a full
   ledged demo. And besides, 286-based machines are a dying breed.
   
Q: How did you learn to code as you do now?
A: Learning to code demos is a long and very very difficult process. It takes
   years to learn to code demos very well. A good way to start is some high
   level language like Pascal or C and then started to experiment with 
   assembler. It takes a lot of time and experimenting to get better, and
   there are no shortcuts (for book recommendations, see a question before
   this). The main thing is trying to understand what you do, then trying
   to change the program to see what you get, and gain wisdom in what's
   the best way of doing things. Learning to code well requires a lot of
   patience, a lot of enthusiasm and a lot of time. It is not easy.

Q: What programs do you use to do your demos?
A: We use the following programs to do our demos; For code we use 
   Borland C++, Microsoft C, Borland Pascal and of course TASM (Turbo
   Assembler). For graphics we use Deluxe Paint 2 Enchanded (and 3D Studio
   2.0). For making the music we use Scream Tracker 3.0 beta, and for 
   digitizing the samples for our songs we use Advanced DigiPlayer 2.5
   beta. Scream Tracker 3.0 and Advanced DigiPlayer are our own programs
   made by Psi, and they are not available to the public at this time.
   In addition to all these, we of course have a big collection of 
   utilities we have crafted to our need during the years.
   
Q: I'm a beginner programmer. I wonder if you could help me learn demo coding?
A: To help beginners learn the secrets of democoding we have released the
   full source of our Mental Surgery demo. This source code is spread along
   with our STMIK (Scream Tracker Music Interface Kit), which is a 4 channel
   music player, which you can link into your own programs. You can find these
   from our distribution sites, under the name STMIK020.ZIP (be sure to grab
   STMIKFIX.ZIP too, which fixes one nasty bug). Do not try to ask us send
   you some of our unreleased source code.
   If you are reading this file, you probably know already that we have
   released a new source code pack which includes the full, documented
   ASM source code of our new StarPort intro II.
   There's always the possibility that we will release some other source code
   in the future as well, but at this time there are no immediate plans for
   such an event.

Q: What is the complete list of your released productions with release dates?
A: To date, we have released the following productions:

Q: Exactly where do FC members study and what?
A: Many of us study in high school or in university. Here is the complete list:

        Psi             - Turku university, major informatics
	Trug    	- finished his studies
	WildFire 	- last year in high school
	Purple Motion	- second year in high school
	Skaven		- not studying at the moment
	Pixel		- last year in high school
	Marvel		- last year in high school
	Abyss		- last year in high school
        GORE            - studying in business school

Q: How long does it take to make a demo like Second Reality?	
A: The complete time that it takes to make such demo can't really be counted.
   Most of our knowledge is based on years of hard work and on our previous
   works. All of us do little experiments on their freetime and when a 
   "critical mass" is achieved the making of a demo begins more seriously.
   From this point to a final demo (in the case of a major production like
   Second Reality) it takes around three to six months.

³10:                  CREATIVITY DEMO NET (CDN) INFORMATION                   ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

  Creativity Demo Net or shortly CDN is nowadays quite a common sight
among BBS'es that are oriented towards demos. But what exactly is CDN?

  The idea behind The Creativity Demo Net(work) is now about 2 years
old. I had been dreaming about having a way to communicate electronically
between different demogroups. When we (Future Crew) attended Megaleif
Easter Party'92 last year in Uppsala, Sweden, I was positively surprised
when I found out that Mirage / Cascada had also been thinking about the
same thing. We both thought that it was a good idea and began developing it.

  But it didn't work out as we intended. There were a lot of difficulties,
in Sweden and here in Finland. At first we tried to spread the net via FidoNet,
but soon it came clear to us that demogroups needed their own net. The
same time I had been also talking with Trojaner (SysOp of Skull's Southern
Germany HQ) and he was also inspired by this idea. We decided that Skull
and Future Crew wouldn't be enough to start a new net with, so I contacted
Arjan Pool (who had relations with DCE) and he also thought that the idea
was just great. And we got underway.

  At first the net was called just plainly DemoNet, but it was almost 
immediately changed to Creativity Demo Net. Anyway, at first it was planned
that StarPort would become the World HQ, but as Arjan wanted to take the job
and all the big responsibilities, Arco BBS became the WHQ (and still is). Much
of the coming success of CDN was based on Arjan's continuing hard work for CDN.

  The net started working in August 1992, four months after the first idea
about a demonet had come to me. And after that the net has spread like a
wildfire! At first CDN spanned only 3 countries (Finland, Holland and Germany)
but soon Sweden joined in, and then country after country and bbs after bbs
joined in. To this date CDN spans the following countries: Finland, Holland,
Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Denmark, Sweden, England, Italy, Turkey, Belgium,
Canada, USA, France, Hungary, Brazil, Austria and Australia. THAT'S 18 
COUNTRIES! And there are about 140 nodes in CDN, all BBS's that are demogroup's
BBS'es. Considering the small amount of demogroup BBS'es, I would estimate
that about 75% of all demogroup BBSes are connected to CDN and all of the
biggest groups like FC, Triton, Renaissance, Cascada, etc... are connected
to the net.

  So what kind of echoes does CDN carry? Well here is the complete list of
echomail areas:
  
*    1. CDN.4ALL
        The area for everyone in CDN
*    2. CDN.ANNOUNCE
        Made a new demo ? announce it overhere.
*    3. CDN.DISKMAG
        All information about diskmagazines
%    4. CDN.CHAT
        All chatting with other members
%    5. CDN.PROGRAMMING
        For help with programming problems
%    6. CDN.GFX
        For all graphics makers
%    7. CDN.MUSIC
        MIDI/MOD/MUSIC help and questions
S    8. CDN.TEST
        Test area
!    9. CDN.INTERGROUP
        For selected groups within CDN
S   10. CDN.SYSOP
        Sysops CDN only
H   11. CDN.HQ_HOST
        For mail between HOSTS versus HQ

* - for everyone who gets
    connected to a BBS
% - for registered persons
    (demogroup members)
S - only for CDN sysops
H - only hosts and HQ
! - for special selected groups

  CDN has areas for relaxed talk between people (and it gets QUITE
relaxed sometimes, and QUITE weird =), but it's just fun!), and for
serious purposes such as programming.

  And what does CDN require from a BBS? Well, the first and MOST
important requirement is that the BBS is some demogroups (preferably an
active one) BBS. That is rule that there are only few exceptions from.
But otherwise, you just have to:

 - place the completed files of the CDN on his/her BBS that everyone
   can download them
 - use the CDN nodelist and it's updates
 - connect to every area available to them

  Not too many rules... And that is because we want CDN to be fun,
not some playground for idiots with a lawbook for brains.  
Also, there are ABSOLUTELY no charges in CDN, so the only costs you have to 
pay are your own phonebills.

  You can FREQ more info about from for example the WHQ under the magic name
CDNINFO. So, get more info now if you are interested in joining in!

        In addition, you can get our demos from internet where
        a very good anonymous ftp demo site is ftp.uwp.edu. Our demos
        can be found in the directory: /pub/msdos/demos/groups/future.crew.

³12:              HOW TO BECOME A FUTURE CREW DISTRIBUTION SITE               ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ

         We are looking for distribution sites around the world.
         We are looking for demo-oriented BBS'es that are interested
         in becoming part of FC's growing number of BBS'es.

         So, what does it take to become an FC distsite?
         In fact, it's not easy, we require a lot, but before
         giving up, take a look at the following list:
         
                 - Your BBS MUST have every single one production
                  FC or any member of FC has ever RELEASED
                
                - Your BBS has to call StarPort (FC WHQ) at least
                  twice a month, and keep in contact with the FC
                  
                - Your BBS also has to be a voting place for our possibly
                  continuing Worldcharts diskmag (voting door)
                  
                - Your BBS has to be absolutely DEMO-ORIENTED, NOT
                  some gigantic all-around BBS. YOU yourself have
                  to be very interested about demos and the PC demo
                  scene in general
                  
                - Your BBS should join the Creativity Demo Net, if
                  by any means possible
                  
                - Your BBS would also be a Future Crew information
                  forum. You would have to answer questions concerning
                  FC and our production, and help people who have
                  problems with our software
                  
                - Your BBS should be operated on a PC compatible,
                  with at least a 14400 BPS modem and 300 megabytes
                  of diskspace for demos, and the BBS should be open
                  24 hours a day, and 365 days / year

        So what do you get in exchange? Well, these things we can
        guarantee:
        
                - Your BBS will be mentioned in every FC production
                  in the distsite BBS list
                - You have a chance to get all FC's future productions
                  first hand
                - You will get some FC inner circle information
                
        What we can't guarantee, but what is likely to happen, is that
        your BBS will become more and more popular and it's quality
        will improve dramatically. 
        
        Remember that we already have BBSes in most of the european
        countries (check out the BBS list), but there are still some
        gaps left which we'd like to fill out. In the USA and Canada,
        we are accepting one BBS per state.

        Please read the above rules carefully and think twice before

 - 1986-1987 -
  Future Crew (FC) was founded in the year 1986 on the C-64. And only one
 member has been in the group for the whole time - Psi. FC did two
 demos on the C-64 before changing into the PC scene in the year 1988.

 - 1988 -
  FC's first PC demo was a CGA sinus -scroller called GR8. At that time
 the members were HAL, JPM, SS (Psi) and SIDDER. And DARK POWER
 was FC's BBS.

 - 1989 -
  Then there came YO! which was quite popular for a while. It used one of
 the VGA's textmodes and included 'nice' PC-speaker music. It had
 many scrollers, a sinusing YO!-logo, a little bouncing ball and
 a 2D-starfield. At this time ICE joined and so FC
 had another BBS - SILICON DRAGON.

 - 1990 -
  In the year 1990 there was only one demo release from us, the Slideshow I.
 It was the first PC demo which included 4 voice SoundBlaster music.
 It didn't include any other special code for it was a VGA picture
 slideshow. And at this time there were a lot of members in FC:
 Psi, ICE, HAL, JPM, SID, BIG, DAC, MAC and SEBU.

 - 1990 -
  And only shortly after Slideshow I, Psi released his ScreamTracker 2.0 -
 a 4 voice music editing program inspired by the Amiga SoundTracker.
 ST 2.0 was a real success. But of course, it didn't take much time
 when a pirated version was on the move. This was in the year 1990.

 - 1991 -
  In summer 1991, FC released a demo called Mental Surgery. It had
 a big scroller on the top of the screen, 3D-starfield, a nice writer,
 music scopes and of course 4 voice SoundBlaster music.
 This was the last FC demo that worked on a 286 machine. At this
 time the members were: Psi, ICE, Dr.Venkman and Purple
 Motion. And only a while after this I (GORE) joined FC and ICE lost
 the interest to demos and left FC along with his BBS. And
 Dr.Venkman went crazy by selling his computer and retired for a while.

 - 1992 -
  So, FC lived quietly for about half a year. But when the year
 1992 came Trug, Pixel, Skaven and Abyss joined FC. And as Abyss
 joined, FC had a BBS again, namely StarPort. So, in the
 beginning of the year 1992 FC had the following members:

 1. Psi --- Main coder
 2. Trug --- Asst. coder
 3. GORE --- Organizer/asst. GFX-man
 4. Pixel --- Main GFX-man
 5. Abyss --- BBS support/utilities
 6. Skaven --- Musician/asst. GFX-man
 7. Purple Motion --- Musician

  It was at this time that we had begun making UNREAL. Our first
 plan was to release it at MEGA-Leif Convention - An Atari ST/PC party
 held in Uppsala, Sweden. But about a month before MEGA-Leif,
 MeeGosh/Rebels (Amiga) called me and told me about ASSEMBLY'92
 and that it would be cool to have also the PC scene there. So, he
 asked us to do an invitation intro for the PC scene about this
 mega-event. We agreed and so, UNREAL was put to rest as Psi got
 the idea of making something different - namely the Fishtro.
 It took us about two weeks to create Fishtro from nothing, but
 when we went to MEGA-Leif Convention, we still had little bugs in it and
 therefore we couldn't release it until a week after MEGA-Leif. 
 We also competed with Fishtro in the MEGA-Leif PC demo compo, but
 we were never told who came second. As the people who were at MEGA-Leif
 remember, the belgian Raiders Brothers won the demo compo, but
 they have not released their winning demo to this date (13.7.92).
 After we came back from MEGA-Leif, we started on making UNREAL again.
 And Dr.Venkman came back from his retirement.

 - 1992 -
   Then Unreal was released. Unreal was the first really big megademo for PC and
 it hit the top of the charts immediately.
 
 - 1992 -
   Then we were contacted by the organizers of a BIG Amiga/C64/PC party, called
 The Party 1992. They asked us to organize the PC demo compo there and make
 again an Invitation Intro for it's PC side. So The Party 1992 Invitation Intro
 was made. At that time we had the following members:
 
 Psi            - Code
 Trug		- Code
 WildFire	- Code
 Pixel		- GFX
 Purple Motion	- Music
 Skaven		- Music & GFX
 GORE           - Organizer
 Abyss		- BBS support
 
  The Party 1992 Inv. Intro was mostly coded by Psi and WildFire. WildFire was
 our new coder who joined us in autumn 1992. He had before been active on the
 Atari ST scene.
 
 - 1992 -
   Then it was the time for another big demo. The making of Panic! began.
 It was the normal process of making demos with blood and sweat and annoying
 deadlines. WildFire was the one to assemble the demo together, but lots of
 code was also done by Psi and Trug.
 
  Then it was the time for The Party 1992. As we thought that it would really 
 nice to get as many people as possible to The Party as cheaply as possible,
 we decided to organize a bus trip there with the amiga people. So we managed
 to load two buses full of computer freaks and take our leave towards The
 Party. At that time The Party 1992 was the biggest computer party ever.
 There were about 2500 computer freaks of which around 400 were PC dudes.
 
  There we entered the demo compo with Panic, and to our surprise we came
 second. Witans Facts of Life had won the demo compo. We were quite 
 disappointed by this, because there was absolutely no voting. The voting 
 system on Amiga just didn't work. And then some organizer just asked the last
 remaining PC organizer "What do you think were the best demos" without telling
 him that these were going to be the official results. And without thinking he
 just said "Witans, FCs and Sonics". 
 
  Anyway, The Party 1992 was a big success.
 
 - 1993 -
   After The Party 1992 we lived quietly for awhile. The only big change was
 that Marvel (formerly from Sonic-PC) joined us. So we now have two gfx 
 artists. Then we began thinking of making a diskmag. At first nobody really
 wanted to code it, so we thought that we would make it as a co-operation 
 with Stone (a finnish demogroup). But after some co-operation troubles we
 began making it 100% by ourselves. We tried to make it the best diskmag
 on the PC and according to many opinions, we succeeded quite well. What
 we tried to do, was to set an example on how well you can do diskmags if
 you really try. The diskmag was coded by Psi and the GFX were done by
 Pixel and the musics by Purple Motion and C.C.Catch from Renaissance.
 
 - 1993 -
   Then it was the time for Assembly'93. Once again we were the PC organizers
 and we made an invitation intro for it. It's name is quite easy to guess,
 it's Assembly'93 Invitation Intro (hard one! =)). It was coded by Trug,
 the GFX were done by Marvel and the musics by Purple Motion. It fulfilled
 its purpose (to get as many people as possible to Asm'93) very well.
 
  Assembly'93 was the biggest ever summer demo party. There were about 1300
 people on the party place of which around 450 were PC demo freaks. Asm'93
 was also a big advancement on the PC side. For the first time we also had
 a intro, music (4 channel and multichannel) and graphic compos. 
 
  Our biggest production yet, the Second Reality won the PC demo competition.
  You have most probably also seen it, so I won't (again) go into detail in
  trying to describe its effects.
  
  At the moment we are looking ahead to The Party III: The Ultimate. We are
again organizing a bustrip to Herning (were the party is to take place). We
really recommend this party because we feel that The Party III is going to
be the biggest and coolest demo party for PC ever. So be there or be square!

³14:                       ANSWERS TO RUMORS                                  ³
ÀÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÄÙ


	Rumors:   - The computer was changed to a faster one to run Second
		    Reality.
		  - An additional GUS was added to machine.
		  - The VGA card was changed to a faster one.
		  - Marvel scanned his picture (Ice Kingdom)
		  - Marvel didn't compose his tune "Can't remember you"
		  - FC did something to the tunes, because they sounded so
		    weird.		    
		  - FC used dirty tricks in the The Party II
		  - FC skipped some parts of other groups demos to hurt their
		    score
		  - FC conducted a ballot-stuffing (fake voting)

        Question 1) Was the computer changed?
        Answer   1) No. All the competitions (music,gfx,intro and demo) were
                    run on the same 486/33mhz 64kb cache GUS 1mb and ET4000
                    1mb machine with 4mb of RAM. This machine belongs to me
                    (Abyss) and is the very same machine (except for the GUS)
                    which was used to display the demos at The Party II.


        Question 2) Did you change the VGA card?
        Answer   2) No we didn't. The same ET4000 1MB VGA card was used all
                    the time.


        Question 3) Was a second GUS card added to the machine?
        Answer   3) At first few months before the Asm'93 we thought that
                    Dolby Surround Pro Logic was only possible to make
                    if you had 2 GUSes. Then we found out that it is very
                    easy and possible to do with only one GUS card. So no
                    second GUS card was added.


        Question 4) Why is Marvels Ice Kingdom so like BEAR1.GIF?
        Answer   4) Let me explain at first about the background. Most of
                    you arent familiar with the Amiga scene. On the amiga
                    scene it is forbidden to scan a picture, but it is
                    ok to use a existing picture as a model from which to
                    draw. What this means is that many of pictures made
                    are not ORIGINALLY created by the author (for example,
                    EEVI which came second at Asm'93 is originally by H.
                    Giger (the guy who did the gfx for Alien (I-III) for
                    example)).
                    What Marvel did was, that he draw the outlines from the
                    BEAR1.GIF and the proceeded on his own with the most
                    difficult task. If you compare BEAR1.GIF and ICEKNGDM.LBM
                    1) they are in different resolutions
                    2) there is no wall in the ICEKNGDM.LBM
                    3) if you zoom in the picture you will see that the
                       colouring (dithering) of the picture is completely
                       different than in Marvels picture.
                    4) BEAR1.GIF looks scanned, it looks helluva good and
                       it looks very different than Marvels picture.


	Question 6) Did Marvel compose the tune "Can't remember you"
	Answer   6) Yes, he did. Among his other talents, Marvel is a quite 
	            good composer. He has made around 5-6 tunes during his
                    amiga career (though not too famous songs). He composed
                    the "Can't remember you" using ST ]I[ beta.
		    

	Question 7) Did you refuse to use any other player than ST3?
	Answer   7) No we didn't. Most of the songs were supplied to us as
		    plain MOD files. No player was included with them. Only
		    one song had it's own player, and that player was used
		    to play it. In the Assembly'93 text file there was a 
		    notion:"Bring your own player" (about the PC multichannel
		    competition). Because no player was supplied with most of
		    the MODs/multichannel files, we used the best player
		    we know of, the ST3 beta.
		    It is also claimed by people who have never used nor
		    seen ST3 that ST3 has still serious bugs in its .MOD
		    capabilities. This can't be more wrong as ST3 is one of
                    the very few composers that really play all Amiga commands
		    really correctly, not like many PC composers. So it's more
		    likely that composer used to create the tune wasn't enough
                    Amiga MOD compatible than ST3 to have bugs in it's MOD
		    playing module.
	

	Question 8) Did you do something to the tunes to make them sound so
	            weird?
	Answer   8) No, we didn't. The PA system broke down. The left speaker
	            broke and didn't play most of the middle-sounds. We are
		    very sorry for this, but it's very rare that this kind of
		    things happen.
		    
		    
	Question 9) Did you use dirty little tricks in The Party II?
	Answer   9) Rick Dangerous / S!P has claimed that we used the 
		    following dirty trick in The Party II:
		    	 ù First telling everyone there'll be no demo from them
			 ù then, all of a sudden, at the END of the compo Gore 
			   shouted (you know in this certain style) And Now! 
			   The new demo by the Future Crew.... (all other things 
			   were anounced like uhh.. hmm yes.. copper? by humm...  
			   surbrisse..?...)
			 ù and finally they turned the volume up to give the 
			   sound a special boost...
		    
		    1) We telled nobody of our demo (Panic) because we feared
		       that it would scare off people. The almightyFC is gonna
		       do a new demo, we can't win, so why compete? We thought
		       we could this way get a lot better compo. 
		    
		    2) Gore shouted? In fact the man who announced ALL the
                       competitions (Amiga, PC and C64) was some of the Amiga-
		       organizers. We didn't even know him. In fact Gore was
		       nowhere near the compo room, only I and Wildfire were
		       (of FC) at the compo room.
		    
		    3) We couldn't have boosted the volume because PA system
		       was operated by two other guys. They controlled the 
		       volume during all the compos. Not us.
		       
		       
	Question 10) Did FC skip parts of other groups demos?
	Answer   10) Yes. Some parts were skipped because the demo run just for
	             too long displaying the same effects all over again. 
                     If the audience began almost to die of borement because
		     of looking at the same boring screen for 3-4 minutes it
		     was the time to skip to next part. This could have not
		     hurted the group, because people already were bored with
		     the screen. Boring them more would affected the groups
		     score even more.

		     
	Question 11) Did FC conduct a fake voting?
	Answer   11) The counting of votes was an open happening. Anybody could
	 	     have joined us to help with the counting. We invited 
		     everybody to join us. We made every attempt to make the
		     voting as reliable as possible and it's our opinion that
		     the votes were counted as correctly as possible.
		     What comes to faking votes, it is a complete lie. No votes
		     were forged. The results of the music competitions might
		     have been surprises, but for those surprises only the
		     voters can be blamed.
